# Agentic AI Portfolio Projects

Recruiters and hiring managers aren’t impressed by yet another copy-paste Agent framework demo.  

What does stand out is depth in Agentic AI systems – the kind companies actually deploy.  
Here are 3 portfolio projects that show you’re serious:

---

## 1. CLI Agent (like Claude Code or custom-built)

- **Why it matters**: CLI agents can do way more than browser/IDE bots. They have system-level access to files, commands, processes.  
- **Skills you prove**: File ops, shell command execution, workflow integration, multi-step context management.  
- **Impact**: Demonstrates automation of dev workflows with zero limitations.  

**Example**:

## 2. Multi-Agent Workflow

- **Why it matters**: Businesses want agents that collaborate – not just solo bots.  
- **Skills you prove**: Orchestration, role assignment, inter-agent comms, error handling, plugging into real company data.  
- **Impact**: Think automating a full sales pipeline or customer onboarding. That’s a business case, not just a project.

## 3. Custom MCP Server

- **Why it matters**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the backbone of modern AI infra.  
- **Skills you prove**: Protocol implementation, server design, tool integration, handling structured request/response patterns.  
- **Impact**: Shows you can build enterprise-ready infra instead of toy apps.
